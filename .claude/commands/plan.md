# Create a New Plan

Create a new PLAN.md from the goal description provided: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. Analyze the goal and break it into phases
2. Each phase should be completable in one focused session
3. Order phases by dependency and risk (do uncertain things early)
4. Create PLAN.md with this structure:

```markdown
# [Goal Title] Plan

## Overview

[One paragraph describing what we're trying to achieve and why]

## Phase 1: [Name]

### 1.1 [First task]
- Bullet points describing what to do
- Be specific about files to create/modify/delete

### 1.2 [Second task]
- More details here

## Phase 2: [Name]

### 2.1 [Task]
...

## Execution Order

1. Phase 1 ([Name]) - [brief rationale]
2. Phase 2 ([Name]) - [brief rationale]
...

## Notes

- Testing commands or other helpful info
- Constraints or things to watch out for
```

5. Phases group related work; sub-sections (1.1, 1.2) are individual tasks
6. Keep phases small - prefer more smaller phases over fewer large ones
7. The Execution Order section can reorder phases if dependencies require it

Write the PLAN.md file to the repository root.
