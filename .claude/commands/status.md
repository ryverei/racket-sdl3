# Plan Status

Read PLAN.md and give a quick summary of where things stand.

## Instructions

1. Read PLAN.md from the repository root

2. Report:
   - **Goal**: What we're working toward (from Overview)
   - **Done**: List phases marked with ✓ DONE
   - **Next**: The next phase to work on (per Execution Order)
   - **Blocked**: Any phases marked ⚠ BLOCKED and why
   - **Remaining**: Count of phases left

3. Keep it brief - this is a quick status check, not a detailed review
