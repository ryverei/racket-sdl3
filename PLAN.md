# Implementation Plan: Idiomatic Racket SDL3 Interface

This document outlines the plan for adding an idiomatic Racket layer on top of the raw FFI bindings.

## Goals

1. **Keep `raw.rkt`** - Power users can still access C-style bindings directly
2. **Add `safe.rkt`** - Idiomatic layer with:
   - Custodian-managed resources (automatic cleanup)
   - Racket structs for events (with `match` support)
   - Simpler APIs (fewer pointer manipulations)
   - Contracts for safety
3. **Update examples** one at a time to use the new interface

---

## Phase 1: Window & Basic Loop (`hello-window.rkt`) - COMPLETED

### Files Created

- `safe/window.rkt` - Custodian-managed window and renderer
- `safe/events.rkt` - Event structs with match support, `poll-event`, `in-events`
- `safe/draw.rkt` - Basic drawing: `set-draw-color!`, `render-clear!`, `render-present!`, `delay!`
- `safe.rkt` - Re-exports all safe modules

### API Implemented

```racket
;; Initialization
(sdl-init! [flags])
(sdl-quit!)

;; Window (custodian-managed)
(make-window title width height #:flags #:custodian)
(make-renderer window #:name #:custodian)
(make-window+renderer title width height #:window-flags #:renderer-name #:custodian)
(window-destroy! window)
(renderer-destroy! renderer)
(window-set-title! window title)
(window-pixel-density window)

;; Events (structs work with match)
(poll-event)        ; returns #f or event struct
(in-events)         ; sequence for use with for

;; Event structs:
(quit-event)
(window-event type)           ; type: 'shown, 'hidden, 'close-requested, etc.
(key-event type key scancode mod repeat?)  ; type: 'down or 'up
(mouse-motion-event x y xrel yrel state)
(mouse-button-event type button x y clicks)
(text-input-event text)
(unknown-event type)

;; Drawing
(set-draw-color! renderer r g b [a])
(render-clear! renderer)
(render-present! renderer)
(delay! ms)
```

### Example Update

`hello-window.rkt`: **Reduced from 82 lines to 52 lines** (37% reduction)

Key improvements:
- No `ffi/unsafe` require
- No `malloc` for event buffer
- No `dynamic-wind` cleanup boilerplate
- No manual null checks
- Clean `match` on events with `for/or` and `in-events`

---

## Phase 2: Input Handling (`hello-input.rkt`) - COMPLETED

### Additions

- Added `key-name` function to `safe/events.rkt` (wraps `SDL-GetKeyName`)

### Example Update

`hello-input.rkt`: **Reduced from 127 lines to 89 lines** (30% reduction)

Key improvements:
- No `ffi/unsafe` require
- No `malloc` for event buffer
- No `dynamic-wind` cleanup
- Clean `match` on `key-event` and `mouse-motion-event` structs
- No manual event type casting (`event->keyboard`, `SDL_KeyboardEvent-key`, etc.)

---

## Phase 3: Image Loading (`hello-image.rkt`) - COMPLETED

### New File: `safe/texture.rkt`

```racket
(load-texture renderer path #:custodian)
(texture-size texture)  ; returns (values width height)
(render-texture! renderer texture x y #:width #:height #:src-x #:src-y #:src-w #:src-h)
(texture-destroy! texture)
```

### Example Update

`hello-image.rkt`: **Reduced from 145 lines to 84 lines** (42% reduction)

Key improvements:
- No `ffi/unsafe` require or `sdl3/image` - just `sdl3/safe`
- No manual `malloc` for texture size
- No `dynamic-wind` cleanup
- No manual `SDL_FRect` creation and mutation
- Simple `render-texture!` call instead of manual rect management

---

## Phase 4: Text Rendering (`hello-text.rkt`) - COMPLETED

### New Files & APIs

- `safe/ttf.rkt` - custodian-managed fonts (`open-font`, `close-font!`) and helpers:
  - `render-text` -> custodian-managed texture (or `#f` for empty strings) with `#:renderer` and `#:mode` (`'blended` or `'solid`)
  - `draw-text!` convenience that renders and destroys in one call
- `safe/texture.rkt` - added `texture-from-pointer` for wrapping textures created from surfaces

### Example Update

`hello-text.rkt`: Reduced from ~233 lines to 121 lines (112 line reduction)

Key improvements:
- Uses `sdl3/safe` only; no manual malloc, event buffers, or dynamic-wind cleanup
- Fonts/text rendering via `open-font`, `render-text`, and `draw-text!` helpers (textures auto-cleaned)
- Event handling with `match` on structs (`text-input-event`, `key-event`), simple state loop
- High-DPI font scaling retained via `window-pixel-density`

---

## Phase 5: Shapes & Drawing (`hello-shapes.rkt`) - COMPLETED

### Additions to `safe/draw.rkt`

```racket
(draw-point! renderer x y)
(draw-points! renderer points)   ; points: SDL_FPoint, list/cons, or vector of (x y)
(draw-line! renderer x1 y1 x2 y2)
(draw-lines! renderer points)
(draw-rect! renderer x y w h)
(draw-rects! renderer rects)     ; rects: SDL_FRect, list, or vector of (x y w h)
(fill-rect! renderer x y w h)
(fill-rects! renderer rects)
```

All helpers accept exact numbers, coerce to floats, and handle list/vector inputs. Batched APIs build temporary SDL_FPoint/SDL_FRect arrays under the hood.

### Example Update

`hello-shapes.rkt`: **Reduced from 171 lines to 116 lines** (55 line reduction)

Key improvements:
- Uses `sdl3/safe` only; no manual `malloc` or FFI pointer arithmetic
- Polyline/point batches drawn with `draw-lines!`/`draw-points!` helpers
- Event loop via `match` on event structs; custodian-managed window/renderer

---

## Phase 6: Animation (`hello-animation.rkt`) - COMPLETED

### Additions to `safe/draw.rkt`

```racket
(current-ticks)  ; wraps SDL-GetTicks for time-based animation
```

### Example Update

`hello-animation.rkt`: rewritten to use `sdl3/safe` with match-based events and draw helpers. Uses `current-ticks` for delta time, `draw-line!`/`draw-points!`/`fill-rect!`, and custodian-managed window/renderer. (Testing requires a display; not runnable in headless sandbox.)

---

## Phase 7: Mouse (`hello-mouse.rkt`) - COMPLETED

### New: `safe/mouse.rkt`

```racket
(get-mouse-state)  ; -> (values x y button-mask)
(mouse-button-pressed? mask button)
```

### Example Update

`hello-mouse.rkt`: rewritten to use `sdl3/safe`, drawing helpers, and new mouse utilities. Trail rendering, button indicators, and cursor color are all driven by `get-mouse-state` and `mouse-button-pressed?`. (Not runnable in headless sandbox; requires a display.)

---

| 7 | **DONE** | `safe/mouse.rkt` | `hello-mouse.rkt` |

---

## Design Decisions (Confirmed)

1. **Custodian-managed resources** - Default to current-custodian, allow `#:custodian` override
2. **Event keys** - Keep integers for now, symbols can be added later
3. **Colors** - Separate args `(r g b [a])` with optional alpha defaulting to 255
4. **Rects** - Will accept lists `(x y w h)` for convenience (Phase 5)
5. **Module naming** - `sdl3/safe` for idiomatic, `sdl3/raw` for C-style
