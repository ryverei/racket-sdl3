;; Blocking Event Handling Demo
;;
;; Demonstrates CPU-efficient event handling using wait-event-timeout.
;; Unlike a polling loop that constantly checks for events, this approach
;; blocks until an event arrives (or timeout expires), freeing the CPU.
;;
;; - Uses wait-event-timeout with 1000ms timeout
;; - Shows "Idle update" when timeout occurs (no events for 1 second)
;; - Displays event type and timestamp for each event
;; - Press Escape or close window to quit
;;
;; This example uses the idiomatic safe interface.
