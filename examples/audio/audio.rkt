;; SDL3 Audio example - WAV playback with keyboard control
;; - Press SPACE to play a sound
;; - Press P to pause/resume audio
;; - Press Escape or close window to quit
;;
;; This example demonstrates:
;; - Opening an audio device
;; - Loading WAV files
;; - Creating and binding audio streams
;; - Playing sounds on keypress
