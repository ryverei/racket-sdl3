;; SDL3 OpenGL Example
;;
;; Demonstrates creating an OpenGL context and basic clearing/swapping.
;; Note: This only uses SDL's GL context functions. To do actual drawing,
;; you would typically use a library like 'opengl' or direct FFI calls to GL.
;; Here we just use SDL's minimal context management.

;; You would normally require 'opengl' here for glClearColor, etc.
;; Since we don't want to add a dependency on the 'opengl' package just for this
;; basic binding test, we'll just demonstrate context creation and swapping.
;; The clear color will likely be black or undefined, but the swap should work.
